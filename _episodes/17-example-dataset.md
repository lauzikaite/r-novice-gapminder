Let's start by downnloading Game of Thrones characters' mortality data from [here](https://figshare.com/articles/Game_of_Thrones_mortality_and_survival_dataset/8259680?mc_cid=6ee60dc1ef&mc_eid=f10fe3b3f2)


> ## Challenge 1
>
> Save all three files your `data/` directory and change the working directory to it.
> Now read the `data/character_data_S01-S08.csv` file into R.
